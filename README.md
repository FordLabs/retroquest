RetroQuest is a website that enables teams to run retrospectives online and in a fun way. It is designed to accommodate
both local and distributed teams.

## What is a Retro?

If you are unfamiliar with what a retrospective is, it is a meeting that is held at the end of each iteration on an
Agile team. Retrospectives are designed to allow the team time to decompress and reflect upon what happened during the
iteration and identify actions that can improve the team as a whole.
